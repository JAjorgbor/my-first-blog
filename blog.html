    <span class="date">december 4th 2021</span>
    <div>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="tab"> Hey 🙋‍♂️,</span> my name's Joshua Ajorgbor some of my friends call me "Aj", some "Aj baby"(not a fan of that one🤦‍♂️) and some just call me 'Josh'(thank you Alle). This is actually my first blog, I don’t really have experience
            with this kind of thing but I figured that hey since I’m learning this whole how to make websites thing and I pretty much know how to make a blog post at this point why don’t I just give this thing a try y'know get the feel of it. not that
            I’m looking to become a blogger though😅so uhh where do I begin 🤔....

    </div>

    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        <span class="tab">so</span> first I guess I should tell you who i am and what I’m into, I’ve already mentioned my name and from the whole "learning this whole how to make websites" you should be able to make a healthy guess that I’m a guy who's
        probably into computers at the very least, well you wouldn’t be wrong if you thought so, in fact I’m actually studying computers, (well the science of it anyways )at the time of writing this, I’m currently at veritas university *please send help
        btw, just kidding (or maybe not 😶👀)… Any ways I also should mention that I’m really interested in becoming an ace of a programmer if you know what I mean😅, but incase you don't understand what i simply mean is a guy that's really good at this
        programming thing someone like this guy..

    <h2>my life's actually not that bad right now</h2>

    <p class="paragraph"><span class="tab">CS </span> and school aside, I guess I should tell u a little bit about my current situation. Fact is, my life isn’t really in a bad place right now, I mean sure I’d give anything for something to be different from the way they are,
        but aside from that I’m pretty happy where I am right now, just wished I wasn’t always getting broke all the time😅, that’s something I hope this programming thing will help me get over</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><span class="tab">As</span> for friends, I don’t really have a lot but boy o boy I’m I glad I have the people in my life right now, I got a pal named Alle, got Onyinyechi, got some really stupid roommates, I’m more or less involved with a reaaalllly
        good looking girl right now ( her name will not be mentioned 😏😗 cause she’d kill me if I did😅💀 ). That’s just it to name a few, I met a good number of cool people in this school, and I’m grateful.</p>

    <h1>my conclusion</h1>
    <div>
        <p><span class="tab">Now</span> granted my life may look nice and all but it hasn’t really been a bed of roses, I’ve had my setbacks, heartbreaks, disappointments and all of the other bad stuff that most people go through, this year in particular
            has been the hardest one I’ve had so far, those that are close to me can actually attest to this, life never seemed this hard before this year came along and showed me that life can be really shity at times, I’ve also had to work my hardest
            this year too, heck I’m writing this blog right now at exactly 2:04am and I have to go to church by 8:00am today, It’s been a while since I had a good night’s rest really and apparently my skiny ass is loosing weight (which I didn’t even think
            was possible at this stage but life had to come along and show me that anything bad is possible😒)</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="tab">Bottom</span> line is that shit happens and we have to learn to live with it and move on, now I would normally end something like this with a possitive remark but nothing really comes to mind plus i'm begining to halucinate a
            litle bit😵, so for now i'll take a break and touch this blog again another time later but till then, good night Abuja✌👋</p>
